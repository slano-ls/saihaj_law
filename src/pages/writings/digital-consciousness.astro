            <h2>The Turing Test and Beyond</h2>
            <p>
                Alan Turing's famous test for machine intelligence, proposed in 1950, asks whether a machine can exhibit behavior indistinguishable from a human. But is this really a measure of consciousness, or merely a measure of our ability to <em>simulate</em> consciousness?

            <h2>Defining Consciousness</h2>
            <p>
                Before we can determine if machines can be conscious, we must first understand what consciousness is. Some key aspects include:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Self-awareness:</strong> The ability to recognize oneself as an individual</li>
                <li><strong>Qualia:</strong> The subjective experience of phenomena</li>
                <li><strong>Intentionality:</strong> The ability to have thoughts about things</li>
            </ul>

            <blockquote>
                "The question of whether machines can think is like the question of whether submarines can swim." — Edsger W. Dijkstra
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Neural Networks and Consciousness</h2>
            <p>
                Modern neural networks, while inspired by biological brains, operate on fundamentally different principles. Consider this simplified representation:
            </p>

            <pre><code class="language-python">
class ArtificialNeuron:
    def __init__(self, weights, bias):
        self.weights = weights
        self.bias = bias
    
    def forward(self, inputs):
        # Weighted sum of inputs
        weighted_sum = sum(w * x for w, x in zip(self.weights, inputs))
        # Add bias and apply activation function
        return self.activate(weighted_sum + self.bias)
    
    def activate(self, x):
        # Simple sigmoid activation
        return 1 / (1 + math.exp(-x))
            </code></pre>

            <h2>Philosophical Implications</h2>
            <p>
                The possibility of machine consciousness raises profound questions:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>If a machine can be conscious, what does that say about the nature of consciousness?</li>
                <li>Would a conscious machine have rights?</li>
                <li>Could we ever truly know if a machine is conscious?</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                While we may never have a definitive answer to whether machines can be truly conscious, the pursuit of this question forces us to examine our own understanding of consciousness and what it means to be a thinking being.
